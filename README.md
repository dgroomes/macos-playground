NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring macOS.

**NOTE**: This project is designed for my own personal use.


## Overview

This repository is for me to explore macOS-specific things like `.plist` files, and whatever else I need to "learn by doing"
with regards to macOS. By contrast, I explore computing things in other playground repos like:

* <https://github.com/dgroomes/bash-playground>
* <https://github.com/dgroomes/docker-playground>
* <https://github.com/dgroomes/git-playground>
* <https://github.com/dgroomes/linux-playground>
* <https://github.com/dgroomes/web-playground>


## Wish List

General clean ups, todos and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] I want to create a macOS *application*. Specifically, something that is in the `/Applications/` directory. I want
  to see how an application (process) is launched, how it gets its PATH set, etc.
